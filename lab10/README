Lab #10 - Final Boss (Web Science Systems Development)
Joseph Mampillil

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions:

Part 1:
I assumed that every level that contained more that one item (e.g. the second
level contained both lectures and labs) should be organized as an array. Therefore,
My JSON is filled with array. websys_course is an array of 2 objects, "lectures"
and "labs". Likewise, each of those is an array of object populated with data from
their respective content types, and each of those objects contains an array holding
the title, description, and link.

Part 2:
I assumed that lectures and labs, while displayed in different lists, would both
be visible at all times (i.e. there was no need to display one and not the other).

Part 3:
I made some basic assumptions about what makes a good usernames and password. I
also assumed that when the user wants to archive the course contents, they are
archiving every lecture and lab, and not just the one that is currently selected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Comments:
I never finished Lab 9, but doing this lab definitely made me a lot more comfortable
with using PHP and MySQL. I probably would have played around with CSS more if
this week wasn't packed with assignments.
