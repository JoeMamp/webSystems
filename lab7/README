Lab 7 - Front-end Optimization
11/8/2019

The first optimization I made was to the HTML file. By removing all of the <li> elements
from the body of the HTML I reduced the characters we had and therefore the file size. This
is unnecessary anyway, since we are adding list items to the HTML through JavaScript.

The second optimization I made was moving the CSS and JavaScript to separate files and creating
<style> and <script> tags to link them, and moving the jQuery to the head. This speeds up the
loading time for the page, and separates our concerns (best practice).

The third optimization I made was moving the JavaScript link to the bottom of the body. This
allows the HTML page to load before adding other functionality, improving the loading time of
the page.

The fourth optimization I made was to the CSS itself. I fixed the background: url() (which was
initially a stall error) so that the page could actually load. This greatly improved the
execution time, considering the page did not manage to execute the JavaScript at all to begin with.

The fifth optimization I made was to the CSS and JS files. I used online minifier tools (links are
below) to compress the CSS and JS files. This reduced the size of each of the files.

Using the waterfall request view and a JavaScript profiler like the one bundled with Chrome Dev Tools (Network tab, Timeline tab > Record [at the bottom toolbar]) is encouraged!
If your optimization makes your code unreadable, be sure to include another copy which is more readable.
As normal, there should be a readme file included which explains your observations/comments/assumptions from this lab.

Creativity:
I changed the background image to a COOL one, and changed the text to white for readability.
I also moved the text to the center, hid the bullets, and gave it a pretty cool font (https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=ZCOOL+KuaiLe).
Since I centered the text, the list items also fade out to the left, and with the font it looks pretty cool and fits with the space theme.

------------------------------------ Notes ------------------------------------

1. Removed all of the <li> items (the whole point of the javascript is to automate this * Decreased file size
2. Moved <style> to a new css document, added <link> in HTML head ** Improved execution time
3. Moved the <xxxx> to a new js document **
4. Moved the jQuery <xxxx> to the head **
4. Moved js <script> to bottom of body *** Improved execution time
5. Changed < sign in first js for-loop
6. Fixed background: url() in css **** Improved execution time
7. Removed div.bar from HTML *
8. Minified CSS (https://cssminifier.com/) ***** Decreased file size
9. Minified JS (https://javascript-minifier.com/) *****

Fixing list item event bubbling:
1. Changed .click to focus on "ul"
2. Changed .hide to affect event.target (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_target.asp)

Fixing Show All link
1. Removed href link from showall in HTML, kept # (apparently this wasn't in everyone's file?)
